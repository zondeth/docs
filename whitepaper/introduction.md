# Introduction

The rise of quantum computing poses an existential threat to classical cryptographic systems. Zond, developed under the QRL ecosystem, offers a robust solution with post-quantum cryptography, including XMSS and Dilithium.

However, despite this innovation, Zond remains largely isolated from the existing DeFi landscape. To solve this, we introduce a **trust-minimized, quantum-resistant bridge and orderbook protocol** that:

- Enables ETHâ†”ZND swaps
- Mints and burns ERC-20 `wZND` backed 1:1 with locked ZND
- Supports decentralized trading via an on-chain limit orderbook
