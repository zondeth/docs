# Abstract

We present a non‑custodial, two‑way atomic swap protocol enabling direct, peer‑to‑peer exchange of ZND (native Zond token) and ETH (or any EVM‑chain token) without wrapping or relayers. Leveraging Hashed Timelock Contracts (HTLCs) on both chains, this design ensures either both legs of the swap execute—or neither does—eliminating counterparty risk. Though it does not introduce post‑quantum cryptography on EVM, it delivers maximum trust minimization for cross‑chain asset swaps today.
