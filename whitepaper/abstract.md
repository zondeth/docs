# Abstract

This whitepaper outlines a secure and scalable **bridge protocol** connecting the **Zond Network**, a post-quantum secure smart contract platform, with **EVM-compatible blockchains**, starting with **Base (by Coinbase)**. The protocol allows users to seamlessly **lock ZND** on the Zond chain and **mint wrapped ZND (wZND)** on the EVM side. Conversely, users can **burn wZND** on EVM and **unlock ZND** back on Zond.

To enhance usability and capital efficiency, the protocol includes an **on-chain orderbook DEX** enabling users to **buy and sell ZND for ETH** directly on-chain. This decentralized, non-custodial model brings quantum-resistant security to Ethereum-based ecosystems while unlocking deep liquidity for ZND.
