# Motivation

There is a growing need for:

- **Post-quantum integration** with popular EVM ecosystems
- **Token utility** for ZND in liquidity, trading, and staking
- **Trustless infrastructure** to avoid centralized bridges
- **On-chain trading UX** without centralized price oracles

The Zond-EVM Bridge addresses all of these.
