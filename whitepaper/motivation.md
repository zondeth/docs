# Motivation

[Previous bridge design](https://zondeth.gitbook.io/bridge) for ZND ⇄ EVM mints wrapped tokens that inherit the weakest chain’s security.

HTLC‑based atomic swaps provide a bridge‑less alternative: no mint/burn, no custody, no relayer.

Users demand a trust‑minimized path to acquire or exit ZND while avoiding centralized exchanges.
